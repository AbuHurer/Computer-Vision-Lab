# Computer vision
Getting started with computer vision with basic program to render shadow effects on an infinite plane for a fixed geometry by finding that if point source goes up the quantization error goes down. This approximation has the unpleasant property that it is possible to produce arbitrarylarge quantization error with any finite grid, by changing the geometry.
