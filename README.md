    <h1>COMPUTER VISION</h1>
    <p>
        Getting started with computer vision! In this basic program, we'll explore rendering shadow effects on an infinite plane for a fixed geometry. We'll investigate how the quantization error changes when the point source is elevated. Keep in mind that this approximation has an unpleasant property: it's possible to produce arbitrarily large quantization errors with any finite grid by altering the geometry.
